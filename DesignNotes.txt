Base Form:
  Primary:
    Melee: Side-to-side swing with moderate damage and range (like Merc but slower and harder)
    Ranged: Slow-firing, fast moving bullet with moderate damage (like Artificer but without recharge)
  Secondary:
    Melee: Uppercut jump and dive (based on whether grounded or aerial), dive has small AoE stun
    Ranged: Large bullet with heavy damage and stun (sorta like Artificer but without upcharge)
  Utility: AoE stun with moderate damage, damage based on distance from caster
  Special: Transform to either Encore or Solo form

Encore Form: (Sacrifice own health?) to fire healing orbs at allies, orb health and target based on need
  Primary:
    Melee: Afterimage animation that applies a weaker delayed hit with damage scaled off original
    Ranged: Targets hit with the original projectile will spawn healing orb that targets the nearest ally
  Secondary:
    Melee: Uppercut version applies stun, dive version casts miniature copy of base utility
    Ranged: Allies caught in the blast are given barrier equal to bullet damage
  Utility: Enhanced to heal nearby allies that are in range, and to cause an additional cast from healed allies
  Special: Consume all remaining stacks and give allies barrier based on health and stack count 

Solo Form: Dramatic increase to regen, attack speed, and move speed (at the cost of taking extra damage?)
  Primary:
    Melee: Swing is much wider, hitting targets to the sides of user and applying bleed
    Ranged: Now fires 3 bullets, with the first behaving normally and the others seeking nearest enemies
  Secondary:
    Melee: Replaces both versions with a forward lunge that deals large damage, stun, and knockback
    Ranged: Bullet now creates smaller seeking bullets that hit nearby enemies (like Artificer full-charge but faster)
  Utilty: Larger AoE than original, applies bleed and armor debuff to enemies hit
  Special: Consume all remaining stacks and deal map-wide damage based on stack count
