Base Form:
  Primary:
    Melee: Side-to-side swing with moderate damage and range (like Merc but slower and harder)
    Ranged: Slow-firing, fast moving bullet with moderate damage (like Artificer but without recharge)
  Secondary:
    Melee: Uppercut jump and dive (based on whether grounded or aerial), dive has small AoE stun
    Ranged: Large bullet with heavy damage and stun (sorta like Artificer but without upcharge)
  Utility: AoE stun with moderate damage, damage based on distance from caster
  Special: Transform to either Encore or Solo form

Encore Form: (Sacrifice own health?) to fire healing orbs at allies, orb health and target based on need
  Primary:
    Melee: Afterimage animation that applies a weaker delayed hit with damage scaled off original
    Ranged: Targets hit with the original projectile will spawn healing orb that targets the nearest ally
  Secondary:
    Melee: Uppercut version applies stun, dive version casts miniature copy of base utility
    Ranged: Allies caught in the blast are given barrier equal to bullet damage
  Utility: Enhanced to heal nearby allies that are in range, and to cause an additional cast from healed allies
  Special: Consume all remaining stacks and give allies barrier based on health and stack count 

Solo Form: Dramatic increase to regen, attack speed, and move speed (at the cost of taking extra damage?)
  Primary:
    Melee: Swing is much wider, hitting targets to the sides of user and applying bleed
    Ranged: Now fires 3 bullets, with the first behaving normally and the others seeking nearest enemies
  Secondary:
    Melee: Replaces both versions with a forward lunge that deals large damage, stun, and knockback
    Ranged: Bullet now creates smaller seeking bullets that hit nearby enemies (like Artificer full-charge but faster)
  Utilty: Larger AoE than original, applies bleed and armor debuff to enemies hit
  Special: Consume all remaining stacks and deal map-wide damage based on stack count

Visual Design:
  Head: Not sure yet, don't really want a face, but not sure how to reinforce the siren/songstress design
  Outfit: High-low dress with sharp edges (think Skullgirls Eliza) and a slight siren/mermaid motif, likely a v-cut neck for that 80's vibe
    V2: Keep the high-low dress but at an angle, add a sharkskin pattern to the main dress and a single/twin tailfin to end of low side, exposed the shoulder to make right arm more visible
    V3: Maybe not a dress, instead some sort of pareo (single or double-wrapped) with a heart-protector/breastplate, that way the flowing edge can still work while having the "battle-maiden" look
  Legs: Stub feet similar to how the Artificer's legs look, will probably float instead of walk
    V2: May decide to mechanic one of the legs to give a slightly pirate-y look, probably the left leg
  Arms:
    Right: Right arm and hand will be normal, and will not be holding anything as hand movement will be important for ranged attacks
      V2: Will probably want a sleeve of some kind, it should work with the rest of the outfit's styling and could run up to the back of the knuckles
    Left: Left arm will be mechanical starting from the mid-upper arm (think Terminator/DoD3 Zero/Kenshi Skeleton), and will hold the weapon
      V2: May be mechanical from the shoulder in order to get another ball joint showing, but if using the V2 outfit it likely won't show
      V3: Definitely keeping the shoulder human, with a cuff to connect to the mechanical portion, probably just two basic joints to keep skeletal feel
  Weapon: Hybrid winged staff, with the center pike being a microphone and the side pikes being khopesh blades; heavy eqyptian influence with a trident-like look
    V3: Keep the khopesh blades but reduce the staff to a medium sword handle, this will free up motion behind the blade to compensate for limitted sword-hand movement
  
Alternate Costumes: Would like to include references to the main influences that can be unlocked with certain achievements, all will share the same model but with varied colors
  Gold: This is an Eliza/Five reference, and it will unlock by beating Aurelion
  White: This is a Zero/One reference, and it will unlock by maintaining either Encore or Solo for 5 continuous minutes (may change length)
  Blue: This is a Two reference, and it will unlock by killing any boss with a Solo Special (may make it multiple bosses with a single finale)
  Purple: This is a Three reference, and it will unlock by stunning at least 3 friendly units with the Base or Solo Utility (may scrap this entirely)
  Green: This is a Four reference, and it will unlock by fully healing at least 3 friendly units with the Encore Special (may also scrap this entirely)
